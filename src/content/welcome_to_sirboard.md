We know that first impressions are important, so we've done our best to create a great range of products to suit the needs of any electronic enthusiasts. However we can't create every board out there, but we have to start somewhere... so where does this leave us? 
Here! We have started with a few, that ended in many.

#### Let me break it down for you:
1. Breakout Boards. Not for the beginners, but the easiest for us to start off with.
2. AVR1 Series. These guys are a great addition to the Microchip Atmel Series, we will blog about this later...
3. Ye Olde AVR Microchip Atmel series. Yes we talking basically fully arduino compatible chips here. 

### Next up, pics or it didn't happen

Basically a show and tell of whats coming. 

> By the way, if you just want to skip to the part where you buy our stuff... that would be great. 

We are currently working on our store...
